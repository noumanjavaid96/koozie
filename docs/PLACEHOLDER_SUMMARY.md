# Summary of Placeholders in Koozie AI Handover Documentation

This document lists the locations where placeholders exist in the handover documentation, requiring input from the Project Manager, Client, Designer, or other relevant stakeholders.

## 1. `docs/HANDOVER_INDEX.md`

This is the main index file and contains the most placeholders for linking to external assets or information that needs to be provided by specific team members.

*   **Section 1: Technical Documentation**
    *   **Testing & QA Reports:**
        *   `Working Document Location:` *(To be filled in by QA/Project Manager - e.g., Link to Google Drive folder for actual test reports)*
        *   `Working Test Case/Report Location:` *(To be filled in by QA/Project Manager - e.g., Link to Google Drive folder/Test Management Tool for detailed test cases and ongoing reports)*

*   **Section 2: Wireframes & UI/UX Design Files**
    *   **Wireframes:**
        *   `Location:` *(To be provided by Designer/Project Manager. This may be a specific Figma page, Miro board, or a folder within a shared drive. Please link directly to the source.)*
    *   **High-Fidelity UI Designs:**
        *   Verification of the primary Figma link: `(This link was provided in project communications and is assumed to be the master design file. Please verify.)`
    *   **User Flow Diagrams:**
        *   `Location:` *(To be provided by Designer/Project Manager. These may be part of the main Koozie AI Figma file linked above, or a separate document/Miro board. Please link directly.)*
    *   **Prototyping Files:**
        *   `Location:` *(Often available directly within the Figma file linked above using Figma's prototyping features. If separate prototyping files exist (e.g., Adobe XD, Principle), please link them here.)*

*   **Section 3: Project Management & Legal Documents**
    *   **Project Timeline & Milestones:**
        *   `Location:` *(Managed by Aalia Khan and team, typically shared via a Google Drive folder. The specific link to be inserted here by the Project Manager or Aalia Khan.)*

    *   **Service Support Plan:**
        *   Confirmation that the template `SERVICE_SUPPORT_PLAN.md` has been reviewed, finalized, and formally agreed upon with the client.

*   **Section 4: Access Credentials & Key Contacts**
    *   **Access Credentials:**
        *   Reference to a separate, highly secured document for actual credentials. This document itself is not created by the AI but needs to be maintained by the team.
    *   **Key Project Contacts:**
        *   `Location:` *(To be filled in by Project Manager - A list of key contacts... This might be a separate document or a section in a project management tool.)*

## 2. `docs/SERVICE_SUPPORT_PLAN.md`

This document is a template and requires client/provider agreement and specific details to be filled in:

*   **Section 1.3: Term of Support:**
    *   `Start Date:` [YYYY-MM-DD]
    *   `End Date/Review Period:` [YYYY-MM-DD / e.g., 3 months post-launch, then renewable annually]
*   **Section 2: Support Hours and Availability:**
    *   `Standard Support Hours:` [e.g., Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM UK Time (excluding public holidays)]
    *   `After-Hours Support:` [e.g., Only for Critical Issues, or On-call basis - specify terms and potential additional costs]
    *   `Public Holidays Observed:` [List UK public holidays or relevant regional holidays]
*   **Section 3: Issue Classification and Service Level Objectives (SLOs):**
    *   `Target Response Time` column for Critical (S1), High (S2), Medium (S3), Low (S4).
    *   `Target Resolution Time (Objective)` column for Critical (S1), High (S2), Medium (S3), Low (S4).
*   **Section 4.1: How to Request Support:**
    *   `Primary Contact Method:` [e.g., Dedicated Support Email: support@renesistech.com]

    *   Table needs to be populated with actual `Contact Person`, `Title`, and `Contact Details (Email/Phone)` for each escalation level.
*   **Section 9: Signatures:**
    *   Client Company Name.
    *   Support Provider Company Name (e.g., Rensis Technologies).
    *   Signatures, Names, Titles, and Dates for both parties.

## 3. `docs/CHANGELOG.md`

This is a template. It needs to be maintained with actual release versions, dates, and details of changes.
*   The `[Unreleased] - YYYY-MM-DD` section is a template for ongoing work.
*   The `[1.0.0] - YYYY-MM-DD - Initial Production Release` section needs the correct date and any specific details relevant to the first actual production release.

## 4. Other Documents (Generally Complete but Review Advised)

The following documents are largely complete based on available information but should always be reviewed by the project team for any specific details or nuances that might have been missed or require client-specific confirmation:

*   `docs/SRS_Koozie_AI.md`: Check "TBD" sections, especially around specific metrics or future feature details.
*   `docs/Technical_Architecture_Koozie_AI.md`: Confirm specific LLM provider details if they evolve, and any TBD integration points.
*   `docs/API_Documentation_Koozie_AI.md`: Confirm exact API endpoints if they differ from conceptual ones, especially for external services.
*   `docs/Security_Compliance_Koozie_AI.md`: The section on "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Service" notes these are legal/client responsibilities for content. The "Incident Response (Placeholder)" section suggests a formal plan needs to be developed by the client/operational team.
*   `docs/Foo_Dashboard_QA_Observations.md`: The date needs to be filled in: `Date of Observation: (Fill in Current Date)`. This document is a sample; actual QA reports will be separate.

This summary should help in identifying areas that need attention to finalize the handover package.
