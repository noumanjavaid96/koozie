# Testing & QA Reports Structure: Koozie AI

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a structured approach and templates for Testing and Quality Assurance (QA) activities for the Koozie AI application. It outlines the types of testing to be performed, key areas to focus on, and a suggested format for reporting test results. As Koozie AI is built on Bubble.io, testing will involve validating workflows, UI elements, data integrity, integrations, and overall user experience.

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers:
*   Types of testing relevant to a Bubble.io application.
*   Guidance on what to test for key features of Koozie AI.
*   A template for individual test cases.
*   A template for a summary QA report.
This document is a **guide and template repository**; actual test execution and detailed report generation are ongoing processes managed by the QA team.

### 1.3 Target Audience
QA testers, developers, project managers.

## 2. Testing Strategy

### 2.1 Levels of Testing
*   **Workflow Testing (Unit Testing Equivalent):**
    *   Testing individual Bubble.io workflows to ensure they execute correctly, handle conditions properly, and produce the expected outcomes (data changes, UI updates, API calls).
    *   Bubble.io's debugger (step-by-step mode) is essential for this.
*   **Integration Testing:**
    *   Testing the interaction between Koozie AI and external services:
        *   Google Gemini LLM API & Tavily API (e.g., prompt effectiveness, search result integration, response handling, error states).
        *   Stripe API (e.g., subscription creation, payment processing, webhook handling).
        *   Email Service API (e.g., email delivery, template rendering).
        *   SMS/WhatsApp API (if implemented).
        *   CRM API (if implemented).
*   **User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Testing:**
    *   Verifying that the UI matches design specifications (Figma).
    *   Ensuring the application is responsive across different screen sizes (desktop primary).
    *   Assessing the intuitiveness and ease of use of the application.
    *   Checking for visual consistency, correct spelling ("Koozi"), and branding.
*   **Functional Testing:**
    *   Testing end-to-end functionality of features as defined in the SRS (e.g., user registration, chat interaction, goal creation, admin panel functions).
*   **Security Testing (Basic):**
    *   Verifying privacy rules are correctly implemented (users can only access their own data).
    *   Checking role-based access controls (admin vs. standard user).
    *   Ensuring sensitive data is not exposed in URLs or client-side.
    *   (Note: Comprehensive penetration testing is a specialized activity, potentially out of scope for this internal guide but recommended).
*   **Performance Testing (Basic):**
    *   Observing page load times for key pages.
    *   Monitoring responsiveness of the chat interface.
    *   (Note: Bubble.io's capacity units and optimization tools can be used for deeper performance analysis).
*   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    *   Testing by end-users or client representatives to ensure the application meets their requirements and is fit for purpose. Feedback from client chat logs is a form of UAT.

### 2.2 Testing Environments
*   **Development (Test Version in Bubble.io):** Most testing occurs here. Has its own database.
*   **Live Version (Production):** Limited smoke testing after deployment to ensure critical paths are working.

## 3. Key Areas for Testing

Based on the SRS and chat logs, the following areas require thorough testing:

### 3.1 User Account Management
*   Signup (email, social), OTP verification, resend OTP, OTP expiry.
*   Login (email, social), incorrect password/email handling.
*   Account linking (social login with existing email).
*   Profile updates (name, picture upload - size/type restrictions, loader).
*   Password change (current password validation, loader).
*   Account deletion (confirmation, data removal).

### 3.2 AI Chat Interface
*   Sending messages, receiving AI responses (Gemini).
*   Integration of Tavily API for web search results feeding into Gemini prompts.
*   Context retention in conversations.
*   Correctness of AI responses to various prompts.
*   Handling of clarifying questions by AI.
*   Use of British English by AI.
*   Functionality of "thumbs up/down" feedback, including AI's response to "thumbs down".
*   Relevance and non-repetitiveness of suggested questions.
*   Handling of specific commands (e.g., "create me an avatar," content generation).
*   PDF document upload (size/type limits, alerts), AI processing of document content.
*   Error handling for LLM API (Gemini) and Tavily API failures.
*   Scrolling behavior in chat window.

### 3.3 Task and Goal Management
*   Manual creation of goals and tasks.
*   AI-driven creation of goals.
*   Viewing, editing, and updating status of goals/tasks.
*   Prompting users to create goals.

### 3.4 Subscription Management (Stripe Integration)
*   Subscribing to different plans.
*   Payment processing (requires test Stripe keys and cards).
*   Webhook handling for subscription status updates (active, canceled, payment failed).
*   Display of correct subscription status to user.
*   UI for managing subscriptions.

### 3.5 Notification System
*   Email delivery for OTPs and other notifications.
*   Correctness of email templates.
*   User preferences for notifications (if UI is implemented).
*   SMS/WhatsApp notifications (if implemented).

### 3.6 History Page
*   Display of past chat sessions.
*   Separate tabs for "Recent chat" & "Conversations".
*   "No Chat found" placeholder.
*   Deletion of chats (with confirmation).

### 3.7 Admin Panel
*   **Dashboard/Stats:** Correct display of user counts, feedback stats.
*   **User Management:** Viewing user list, correct display of user types.
*   **Content Management (FAQs, Documents, Videos):**
    *   CRUD operations for FAQs (validation for save button, loader, DOB constraint if applicable, question mark).
    *   Document upload for AI knowledge base.
    *   CRUD for Featured Videos (YouTube link handling, "feature on dashboard" option).
*   **Feedback Management:** Viewing user feedback.
*   Access restrictions (only admins can access).

### 3.8 General UI/UX
*   Spelling ("Koozi" vs. "Koozie").
*   Responsiveness (basic check on common viewport sizes).
*   Adherence to Figma designs.
*   Loaders for long operations.
*   Clarity of error messages and alerts.

### 3.9 Security (Basic Checks)
*   Confirm a standard user cannot access admin pages or admin data via direct navigation or API calls (if any exposed).
*   Confirm a user cannot view or edit another user's goals, chats, or profile information.

This structure provides a framework. The QA team should adapt and expand upon it as needed based on the specific testing phase and project requirements. Regular communication of test findings with the development team and project manager is crucial.
