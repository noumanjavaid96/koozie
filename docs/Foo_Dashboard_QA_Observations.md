# Foo Dashboard QA Observations (Based on HTML Structure)

**Project Name:** Koozie AI
**Page Tested:** Dashboard (`/dashboard?tab=dashboard`)
**Date of Observation:** (Fill in Current Date)
**Observer:** Jules (AI Assistant)

**Disclaimer:** This is a speculative QA observation report based *solely* on the provided HTML structure of the dashboard page. It does not involve live interaction, functional testing, or knowledge of all expected behaviors. It's intended as a starting point for more detailed, human-led QA.

## 1. Overall Page Structure & Key Sections
*   **Header Section:**
    *   Observed: Contains Koozi AI logo, user profile image/icon.
    *   Suggested Checks:
        *   Logo navigates to the main dashboard/home.
        *   User profile icon/image is correctly displayed for the logged-in user.
        *   Clicking user profile icon opens a dropdown with relevant links (e.g., Profile, Settings, Logout).
*   **Welcome Section:**
    *   Observed: "Welcome to Koozi AI!" message, and introductory text.
    *   Suggested Checks:
        *   Text content is accurate and uses correct branding ("Koozi").
*   **Main Action Cards ("Inspire Me", "Koozi Chat"):**
    *   Observed: Two prominent clickable cards with icons, titles, and descriptions.
    *   Suggested Checks:
        *   "Inspire Me" card navigates to the correct section/feature.
        *   "Koozi Chat" card navigates to the chat interface or opens a chat modal.
        *   Hover states and clickability are clear.
        *   Icons and text are displayed correctly.
*   **Insights Section ("Your Goals", "Training Videos", "Resources"):**
    *   Observed: Three cards displaying numerical stats (0 goals, 21 videos, 4 resources based on HTML).
    *   Suggested Checks:
        *   Numbers dynamically reflect the actual user/system data.
        *   Clicking on these cards navigates to the respective sections (Goals page, Videos page, Resources page).
        *   Icons and text are displayed correctly.
*   **Featured Video Section:**
    *   Observed: A section with a video player.
    *   Suggested Checks:
        *   The correct featured video (as set in admin) is displayed.
        *   Video player controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen) are functional.
        *   Poster image loads correctly before video play.
*   **Resources Section (Downloads):**
    *   Observed: Search input ("Search here"), a repeating group of downloadable resources (e.g., "Build, Scale, Sell", "90-Day Planning Guide"). Each item has an icon, title, description, and a "PRO" tag/button.
    *   Suggested Checks:
        *   Search functionality filters the list of resources correctly.
        *   Resource titles, descriptions, and icons are accurate.
        *   Clicking a resource initiates a download or navigates to its details page.
        *   "PRO" tag correctly identifies premium resources. Behavior of clicking PRO button (if it's a button) needs to be defined and tested (e.g., prompts to upgrade if user is not PRO).
*   **Recent Chat Section:**
    *   Observed: A repeating group displaying recent chat sessions with titles and dates.
    *   Suggested Checks:
        *   Lists the user's actual recent chats in reverse chronological order.
        *   Chat titles and dates are displayed correctly.
        *   Clicking on a recent chat navigates to that specific chat session.
        *   Correct icons are displayed for chats.

## 2. General UI/UX Observations (Based on HTML Structure)
*   **Responsiveness:** The HTML structure uses `flex` and `column/row` layouts, suggesting an attempt at responsiveness. Actual behavior across different screen sizes needs manual testing.
*   **Fonts and Styling:**
    *   Observed: SF Pro Display (Bold, Regular) fonts are loaded. Custom CSS variables for colors (`--cc-primary`, etc.) are defined.
    *   Suggested Checks: Consistent font usage, adherence to color palette, correct application of styles to elements.
*   **Interactivity & Clickable Elements:**
    *   Observed: Many `clickable-element` classes.
    *   Suggested Checks: All intended clickable elements are responsive to clicks, provide visual feedback (e.g., hover states), and trigger the correct actions/navigations.
*   **Image Loading:**
    *   Observed: Various `<img>` tags.
    *   Suggested Checks: All images load correctly, are not broken, and have appropriate alt text (if applicable for accessibility, though not visible in HTML structure alone).
*   **Scrollbars:**
    *   Observed: Custom CSS to hide scrollbars.
    *   Suggested Checks: Ensure content that might overflow its container is still accessible (e.g., via mouse wheel scrolling or touch scrolling) even if scrollbars are visually hidden. This can sometimes cause usability issues if not handled carefully.
*   **Loaders:**
    *   Observed: A `canvas-loader` div.
    *   Suggested Checks: Loader appears during page load or long operations and disappears once content is ready.

## 3. Potential Areas for Deeper Testing (Beyond HTML Structure)
*   **Dynamic Data:** Verify all dynamic data points (user name in header, number of goals, list of recent chats, resources, etc.) are correctly fetched and displayed for the logged-in user.
*   **Workflows:** Each interactive element (buttons, links, cards) triggers the correct Bubble.io workflows. Test edge cases and error conditions within these workflows.
*   **API Integrations:** (Not directly observable from static HTML) Test interactions with Gemini, Tavily, Stripe, etc., that might be triggered from dashboard actions.
*   **User Roles & Permissions:** If dashboard content varies by user role (e.g., Free vs. Pro user seeing different resources), test this thoroughly.
*   **Accessibility (A11y):** Perform basic accessibility checks (e.g., keyboard navigation, focus indicators, ARIA attributes if used - though not extensively visible in the provided HTML).
*   **Browser Compatibility:** Test on target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge as defined by project).

## 4. Specific Placeholder Values from HTML (Example for "Insights" section)
*   Your Goals: **0** (Needs to be dynamic)
*   Training Videos: **21** (Needs to be dynamic or configurable in Admin)
*   Resources: **4** (Needs to be dynamic or configurable in Admin)

This mock report should be used as a checklist to guide manual, functional testing of the live dashboard.
